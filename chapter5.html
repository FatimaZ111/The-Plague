<p>He brought the toy in. I Applauded and I clutched on to my toy. Dad striked a pose. We all laughed, our family had a their very own sense of humor. But then dad broke the cabinet <br>
 by the hammer, he was striking the pose so he dident pay attention on what the hammer was doing whirling around. We knew by the sound of the cabinet that wound. <br>
After that day the cabinet always get stuck. Now you see why we called it the stuck-cabinet. Now back to where we were.  <br> </p>
<p>
‘Mind helping me?’ My Aunt said trying to open it. ‘No problem!’ My mom replied. And she went seizing the knob of the cabinet. It was clear that auntie wanted to go and meet mom in private  <br>
but she doesent wants to say it in front of me, she is looking for a justification. She will undertone to her and they will meet in private. <br>
Right now I can break her plans by going to mom she hadn’t whispered to her yet I think. Or maybe I would have plopped in formerly and go to help my aunt saying mom I can! But cherished old aunt,<br>
 I won’t disorder with her procedures.<br> </p>
 <p>
They went up saying ‘if you need me bill I am upstairs’ she said. I quickly ate my food which wasent left much. I quietly spied on them. <br>
Once they were alone, private not really. Auntie began. ‘Billy is hiding something.’ ‘Clearly.’ Said my mom. ‘How could you know?’ ‘Remember a mother has 6981 eyes right? <br>
 These were your words roughly a month ago’ mom said trying not to giggle but I couldent hold it a burst out giving them my hiding spot. <br>
‘Bill! Billy!’ They said. ‘You were hearing us the whole time?’ There was no retort I was too busy laughing. ‘YEAH, APPARENTLY!’ I said recovering from the bottomless laugh. <br>
 ‘Do you think I will not go and see what is happening, I knew what was happening, I mean what you were talking about me, wont I go and hear the important matter the talk after all <br>
  the sus activity. So in simple words I knew your plan.’ <br></p>
  <p>
‘Ok, now as you know about that we know that you are hiding something so why don’t you go ahead and say it out loud?’ ‘It’s a long story. Good night!’ she stopped me <br>
 ‘Ok, ok on my way to hear I came across a house where I stumbled across a journal where was written what his life was like obviously and from the information he MOST POSSIBLY <br>
  is the start of this fatal virus.’ I said not concerned. ‘Show me.’ Said my mom and auntie, mom read the page while I care freely went to bed. <br> </p>
  <p>
I went to my room giving me shivers that the happy life we breathed cannot happen anymore. Remembrances of the past were racing through my mind. I said to myself it had to happen one <br>
 day trying to clear my mind. @@@ <br> </p>
 <p>
I Sighed.  I Went to my desk. There were drawings everywhere. I had a bookshelf, closet kind of thing in my room there were some drawers which I almost never used, I decided to use it. <br>
 I opened it, it was getting stuck by time. There was dust everywhere in the drawer, there were bunch of papers in it the were some very old. I must be a kid there were kid drawing, <br>
  made with crayon. I took the first page and turned it around it had the date 4/6/14 I was five years old. <br> </p>
  <p>
I was looking through commemorations came in my mind giving a nice little impression. I stopped at one It had the date 20/5/13 I drew that a man was wearing a superman costume <br>
 and the toy I esteemed, a slide, the slide which appeared in the day where the stuck cabinet story began. The man would be my father, William. My eyes got damp gloomy little tears came from it.<br>
 My mom came in my room and she dident expect me opening the drawer she just thought I would never open it but she was happy that I did open it. She came by my side she put the hand on my shoulder
  smiled and left. <br></p>
  <p>
I put it away trying to push that thought out of my mind, but it wouldn’t leave. I lay on my bed still trying after an hour which went quickly by I dident manage to get it out of my mind instead <br>
 I just got lost in the memories. After waking up from the memories I realized an hour had passed by. <br> </p>
 <p>
I went out of my room. Everyone was sleeping I could hear the snores I went down the stairs to the cabinet under stairs quietly I opened it, the door creaked but the snores went on.  <br>
It was pitch black inside I opened the light it got open after flickering a little bit. There stood my old favorite toy. The snore stopped but I dident notice… <br>
Until I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly hid behind the couch. I saw mom coming down stairs and then she quickly went to the cupboard under the stairs seeing  <br>
the light was on and the door was opened while I sneakily went to my room and lay on the bed. I heard footstep’s approaching, my mom came opening the door by the sight that  <br>
I was sleeping she went to her room and slept. I heard the footstep’s faded. <br> </p>
<p>
Looks like I was sleepy I slept. Next morning, we had pancakes for breakfast topped with syrup it was delicious then aunt handed me a cup of steaming tea. <br>
 They finally sat down after giving everyone breakfast, mom made the pancakes and Aunt made the tea. ‘Is there any shortage of food? We went for a food hunt in the city’ <br>
  I asked ‘Central?!’ asked mom ‘No’ I replied. <br> </p>
  <p>
I told them all about it. ‘Wow, it was certainly an adventure…sort of.’, said my aunt when I had finished. ‘I think we might need food after a day or so, Alexa and I were Uneasy <br>
 of what we will do when we run out of food but looks like you have some familiarity so we will think what we can do.’ <br> </p>
 <p>
 Breakfast was finished my pancakes were not my tea, it was cold now. Mom and Aunt Alexa had already left the table. I quickly drank my tea even though it was cold. <br>
  ‘Come on Billy news will start any second’ reminded my aunt. I seized the dishes and put them in the sink then I washed my hands.  <br>
I joined the others on the couch, I was right on time, the news started. <br> </p>
<p> <em>  T.V
Host: Welcome back! Today, as you know the virus has increased considerably and we very desire to stop it from killing our loved ones… But…is this desire much that you risk your life to help us?  <br>
As we know WHO is studying the fatal virus and trying their very best to cure it. If we have found who started the virus, please report to us Dr. lupin has some stuff to share with us, <br>
let’s see what he has to say. <br>
Dr. lupin: Yes, thankyou we are indeed trying our very best to help you all, sure this fatal virus that we desire it dident even come in our happy, normal lives that we breathed. <br>
So, please if you have found the person has started this virus please tell us and how you knew that this person has started also bring the stuff, belongings of the person, <br>
it would be very good if you bought his or her journal we will acquire very much information about this virus. Let’s see how stuff is going on in central.<br>
[mystery person]: *whispers* Dr lupin…not central not central. <br>
We looked at each other in curiousness what is she trying to say to dr. lupin but dr. lupin couldent hear the mystery person the voice seems like a woman’s voice <br>
Host: Wait, why? What will it WHO acquire from the belongings of the person who started the virus? <br>
[Mystery person]: *whispers* Sir don’t give flashback of central sir no. <br>
Dr. Lupin: Sorry we can’t tell you that but anyways the flashback of central… <br> </p></em>

<p class="flashback-1">
FLASHBACK <br>
 There was no zombie…instead there was police, and rats where living there, they were in uniform it was a place for people…who work for WHO and news. <br>
the mystery person rode in to view whispered in his ear and he immediately turned off the camera and the flashback, he disconnected. <br> </p>
<p>
There was silence for moment. <br>
Host: Weird…well thanks for watching and…. oh! Dr. lupin just messaged me that…he shared the worng flashback,the flashback was their canceled project the president dident <br>
 want to leave their people behind means he dident waste  all your lives…our lives matter including yours. Cya! <br></p>
 <p>
Everybody was stunned, there was silence I broke the silence by saying ‘sus’ weirdly. ‘ok, that was real weird but now let’s do what we’re supposed to do, which is reporting that diary <br>
to the WHO website.’ Said aunt my mom agreed and begun to open the WHO website. ‘No, we are going to central and then reporting this journal.’ I exclaimed ‘we don’t know where their HQ is--’ <br>
 mom said not completing her sentence <br> </p>
 <p>
 ‘yes, it’s in central…mansion foods, see?! That’s why they made the restrount a mansion which has not been open for years see their top-secret HQ they were undoubtedly lying about <br>
  the project disregarded it was a real flashback the shadowy voice was trying to stop Mr. lupin from showing the flashback which he might be overlooking what is going on there, <br>
   they took advantage of it nobody was going to the central thinking it was filled with metamorphosed rats, they took the prospect and wiped the mutated rats they kept killing them, <br>
    they took all of the rats who were vital I mean were like had an essential job, with their family’ I said there was silence <br> </p>
    <p>
‘you so figured it out.’ Said aunt. ‘Proud of you Billy’ my mom said happily ‘Prepare, at night we shall go, but shall we all? I think we should’ said mom we all arranged that <br>
 we all should go together. <br> </p>
 <p>
I went in the garden sat down, thinking what our journey to central would be like, mom and aunt were looking for a map to mark many, many ways to go to central many ways so  <br>
we could choose another way if some problems come on the way. <br> </p>
<p>
They took 2 hours to mark many, many ways while I was preparing, I choosed everybody’s coat’s they had to be black and well camouflaging with the darkness outside, <br>
 I found torches for everybody including backup torches, found bags, a little food just in case, I took a picture of the map of everybody’s phone <br>
At night we all were ready to begin the journey, we were gawking at the door the map was in moms hand a dog came and ripped the map! That dog was our dog’s son he was hiding all along! <br>
 ‘what! Is that Laila’s son? Laila was our dog who died 6 months ago while giving birth to her kids.’ ‘PLEASE TELL ME YOU TOOK THE PICTURE?’ My mom asked me. <br>
 I got behind my face got shy. ‘I took it in one phone’ I squeaked ‘GREAT! We can message it to everybody’s phone.  Ok a smile performed on my face because I just  <br>
 got saved from an immense scold. ‘Puppy’s name is Laila named after her beloved mom.’ We all agreed that we should name her after her mother, Laila. ‘AWW!’ I said I esteemed Laila! <br>
I Got my phone I looked in the gallery of the phone the picture was not there, I was surprised there was no sighn of it! I was scared I fearfully murmured ‘Oh no!’ <br>
 ‘what?’ asked Aunt Alexa. ‘I can’t find it, but I am pretty sure I took the picture’ *gulps fearfully* ‘what! Are you kidding me!?’ mom said furiously and took the phone from me <br>
 ‘N-no’ I said. She was incisive for the picture. Suddenly I got a thought, I remembered what had happened with the photo. <br></p>
 <p>
‘M-mom I remember I a umm my space was running low so after I umm took the image I perhaps – fallaciously deleted it...’ ‘what really! Ugh!’ mom feverishly said ‘Our work for 2 hours!’ <br>
 Aunt said irritably. Mom went to her rooms did aunt. ‘SORRY!’ I said when they were going to their rooms. <br>
Laila was looking at me. I looked at her I was still very disappointed of myself. I had a very despicable look on my face. I petted her sighing it gave me a little blissful appearance on <br>
 my face because she was smiling at me I grabbed her and took her to my room, I put her down the bed, she played with a pillow by not scratching it but by putting her face on the fluffy, <br>
  heart shaped pillow. <br> </p>
  <p>
While I unlocked the drawer of my desk and took a cute collar which belonged to Laila and I put it on our new Laila. She looked very, very cute in her collar that once belonged to her mom,<br>
 I went down in the garden switching the gardens light on. I went to her mom’s grave we had made 6 months ago. Tears came to my eyes undoing my slight cheerful expression which Little Laila changed,<br>
  smiles certainly do make a change. <br></p>
  <p>
I saw mom beholding at me from her bedroom’s window but when I looked she went. I Was very sad. I heard mom shouting ‘Lights Out!’ I took her to my room I made a comfy bed for her by pillows <br>
and blankets.  I closed the lights and cuddled up on my bed.<br></p>
<p>
After an hour I woke, I don’t know how though. I looked around rubbing my eyes, I saw that Laila was fast asleep in her new bed. I was heading back to sleep but I remembered <br>
that I forgot to close the garden lights, so I went downstairs.<br>
I saw mom and aunt on the counter talking ‘Billy?! What are you doing here?’ Aunt asked me surprised what I was doing here. ‘I was sleeping I don’t why I woke up then I was <br>
just about to go back to sleep then I remembered I forgot to close the garden lights’ after a pause I continued ‘but I think I should be the person asking that what are you doing <br>
 here not you’ I replied ‘well we were – anyways I closed the garden lights’ said Aunt Alexa.<br>
 I joined them on the counter. ‘Couldent sleep?’ I asked  them wondering why they were over here, maybe. @@@</p> <br>
