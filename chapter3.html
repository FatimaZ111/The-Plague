    Mr. Cody turned down the volume. There was silence. A zombie!!!! Shouted Robert Macalester. This is madness! Mutated Rats! Zombies! Zombies were in tales! This is rubbish Robert Shouted.<br>
     What is it then? They sure look like zombies. Mutated rats to me. it is hard to believe, but it sure does look true. *Sighs* yeah… Robert said. <br>
    There was silence. Ok a zombie virus so let’s just. I don’t know it’s very hard to believe.</p> <br>
    <p>
    Ok bed said Mrs. Sofia. Want me to read you a bedtime story? We are not kid’s mom *sighs*. Ok.<br> </p>
    <p>
    In the morning. Mr. Cody made all of us too sit and listen to him. Look as you know about the zombie thing we need to have some rules it’s for your own <br>
    safety it may happen to any of us we don’t know when and this thing is very mad we need rules.Now it’s for kids and adults. Don’t argue that you are not kids. But... dad <br>
     NO just look out there are there just kids mad? There are big people mad too. It could be us any of us no matter who they are.</p> <br>
     <p>
    Ok now whatever you were doing and don’t forget this though. Ok we all said I just simply nodded my head. Mrs. Sofia went to make breakfast It was half already made. <br>
     After ten minutes’ breakfast was ready We were almost finished that Mr. Cody said that after some minutes a news stream will start with Dr. Lupin and the stream many colonies will be  <br>
     live too in the stream.  He ordered Alex to bring the T.V remote. He started the T.V <br></p>
                      <strong> <em>    <p>           TV
    There was a countdown 2:02 2:03 …….  1:00 …. 0:30
    ….. 0:01… <br>
       HOST: Welcome broadcasting live with many colony’s and Dr. lupin! With more information about these mutated rat’s aka zombies....  <br>
    Dr. lupin: Ok so These mutated rats are completely mot human I mean by that is that’s they are dead theres no more brain or heart in them they are not a rat when they are bitten <br>
    And you are free to murder them.<br>
    Colony 3: Do you know what caused this?<br>
    Dr. lupin: No we are working on it but we have seen that there are some changes that’s have been happened but our previous information wasn’t worng either it’s a change. <br>
     Before was that after a bite in 5-10 seconds the rat who has been bitten will become a zombie but now They will become a zombie in 1 minute to a minute and 30 seconds. <br>
    Colony 7:  are the new changes more danger if are so how? <br>
    Dr. lupin: it can be more easy and more dangerous in ways in because In those minutes maybe somebody helps him or her not knowing that he or she is infected. <br> </p> </em> </strong>
    <p><strong> <em>
    Now for the good way if there is a lot of them and some rats get bitten so they also get time to escape or do something, last words or whatever. It is really mysterious how <br>
     this happened I mean that how did it get on all the colony’s so fast a pandemic lets say * sighs* well we are creating a website which tell you about this virus and how much it is spreading <br>
      every day the name is WHO Ebola virus. That’s all for now! <br> </p> </em> </strong>
      <p>
    Mr. Cody turned off the T.V. So everybody there were some changes and we all should really take care Mr. Cody said. After breakfast reading! The same book that you were reading it’s your choice.</p><br>
                              <p>      3 days later
    I woke up next morning I was early all the other kids were sleeping. Mr. and Miss Cody were awake they were worried. Are you- *yawns* ok? I asked them sleepily wondering why were they worried. <br>
     Oh! Go wake the other kids will ya? Well tell you all together bill. Ok I went in the room turned on the lights. I was rubbing my eyes madly WAKEEE Wake up! I shouted few of them woke up. <br>
      Then eventually they all did. we all went where Mr. and misses Cody were. Well sit down on the couch everybody. Mrs. Cody and Mr. Cody sat too.<br>
     Ok, we need to discuss. So… Mr. Cody continued as you know we have been preparing some stuff for the future we have ran out of food we will need to go to the supermarket again. But we are  <br>
     afraid that there might be no more food left in super market. <br> </p>
     <p>
    Waaaa- it are you telling me we need to go to the central! There would be madness there as it’s the central place of our town [ our half town is there] really? The central supermarket well  <br>
    let’s agree there will be lots food there because NO ONE DARES TO GO THERE! Robert continued STOP! Did we ever say about going to the central!?!? Shouted misses Sofia.  <em>Central was a nice place <br>
     there with our green water lakes which came out huge pipes there was happiness there until the virus came. Which I belive humans call a sewer which they are disgusting but not for us we rat! </em> <br>
    Ok look we have to go for a food hunt by going in houses because as in the WHO website its not going good in our colony.<br> </p>
    <p>
    More than half of our colony would be dead *phone rings* I’ll get it! Said Roxanne * answers phone*. It’s for you bill. *I run over there and she hands me the phone* Hello? *talks* *stuns* <br>
    *drops phone* *sobs* Everybody looked at me curious. *Robert runs to me* are you ok? What happened by now everybody was there beside me. These words left my lips…. My father is... <br>
    *everybody looks down and sobs fill the air* those words were barely spoken.@@@ </p> <br>
    <p>
    Everybody got their heads down. Roxane found out that the phone call was still on </p> <br>
    <p>
    my mom was calling out my name bill! Billy! bill! The call is still on she said softly. I put it on speaker. Bill! Mo-m. I am sorry I dident tell you before <br>
     that this happened I was just in a shock. It-s not your fault mom. * CoNnEcTiON LoSt* * girl on telephone speaks* Connection lost tr- I hanged up the phone.</p> <br>
     <p>
    I just quietly went to the room where I sleep. Head down I went sadly. I was there for an hour. Then I came out and I said loudly to everyone if dad died so why are you stopping <br>
     to bring food life must go on sooner or later we will experience tragedy, your rule Mr. Cody “don’t give up if a tragedy happens” you guys are stopping, life must go on sooner or later we <br>
     will experience tragedy and we shouldn’t stop!  Life must go on! You can be sad but don’t give up! Don’t stop this must go on! Must! <br> </p>
     <p>
    Well ok. Everybody freshen up. So we will go on a food hunt going in to people’s houses if they are zombies and take the food? ok? So who is in? ME! I said I have to be in * there was silence <br>
     for a moment* ok anyone else Cody is going too. *he stood up* * sighs* I AM IN said Alex I AM IN said Robert ME TOO!  Said Roxanne. well o would love to go really but Mrs. Sofia and grandma belle  <br>
     or Lizzy you know might need me. Mark continued or if that zombie comes at least * :/ * I can fight. Thanks! Exclaimed Mrs. Sofia. Whenever you are ready said Mr. Cody. Well let’s get our phones and <br>
     whatever we need and bags which have a map, whatever you need or might need you know be ready for whatever will come in the future and also don’t make them heavy I declared. * there was silence <br>
      than everybody looked around for some seconds then they all catered taking whatever they want * don’t forget some pain killers! You might get hurt don’t try putting pain killers if somebody gets <br>
       bitten. YUP! Not silly! Alex said. </p>
       <p>
    Everybody was busy packing up. I was almost too I was by the kitchen counter trying to see if I forgot something. I saw Lizzy coming to Mr. code and saying is it ok if I come too?  <br>
    She was like 7-8years old. Ok. Be careful and quite which I think you are very good at then he shouted Hey Hey EVERYBODY WHO IS GOING!! * everybody stooped and went to him I looked too  <br>
    * Lizzy is going to take care of her she is 1-2 years smaller than you guys keep a little an eye in her ok * looks at Lizzy and says * once again be quite and <br>
     careful Lizzy.  Said Mr. Cody. I kept thinking if I had left to bring anything finally convinced myself that nothing was missing now for weight of the with was ok it isent supposed to be heavy <br>
      or it will trouble us for running and much more. It weighed just I right we all were almost done </p> <br>
      <p>
    done only Roxanne was left and they just got done we went to Mr. Cody. I said that maybe we should all check the weight of our bags in weighing machine and Mr. Cody can tell the limit of our  <br>
    bags need to weigh if they are more of the limit we take away the stuff which isent important. OK, you get nice ideas kid! Well where’s the weighing machine? * Lizzy got the weighing machine * we  <br>
    started weighing all our bags nobody’s bag was over the limit. <br> </p>
    <p>
    Ready got your mobiles take mommy’s Lizzy * she hands Lizzy her phone * and don’t forget to put it on silent you all or those buzzes will definitely give up your spot! * everybody puts on silent * <br>
     ready everybody gets ready put your bags on and let’s get going but first of all let’s see we are going vertical down the alley ways ok? First our neighbor Mrs. Olivia. We all kids saw her mad! <br>
      I said. Ok we are starting form that way. Let’s do this guy’s. we all had dark black coat on for better camouflage <br> </p>
      <p>
    Let’s go Mr. Cody peaked form the curtain no on was there he slowly opened the door trying not to make a creak and it dident we all sighed and crept out. We slowly taking the little <br>
     narrow alley way I had my knife ready for killing those zombies we were right beside Mrs. olives house <br>
    The window was open I looked sneakily there was no one there no one the lights were open breakfast was there but not todays or tomorrow’s breakfast the breakfast of the morning when all of this  <br>
    happened. I showed them a thumbs up while nodding we sneaked to the door it was a little open and we all sneaked in, closed the door we all sighed and wuick we all closed all curtains *  <br>
    we all stopped looked around it was all clear we had to check up I signed Alex to go and check upstairs * she went looked upstairs and showed us a thumbs up * we all sighed * we all looked in  <br>
    the cupboards and fridge there was plenty of food well after all we saw her mad in the early days. Whoa! said Lizzy she was looking in a cupboard we all went and saw there was a lot of canned stuff. <br>
    I send a pic to maam Sofia. She texted all of us back that she’s old that explains it we were in a group. @@@ </p> <br>
    <p>
    Take a few of them Lizzy. I went upstairs, to the bed room. I was looking for something I can find which might come in handy. I went and looked in the drawer of the side table. <br>
     I found candy! Which I dident see coming! I took all of it and checked in the other drawers wow! There was more candy I took all of it and then I checked the other side table in the <br>
      first drawer it had medications and reading glasses and stuff like that. But the lower drawer had more candy I took all of it not leaving a single one of it I had all of the candy I found <br>
       in my hand. </p> <br>
       <p>
    I shouted out loud. Guys! Look what I found! I came to them. WOAH! * every one let out a yelp of surprise  <br>
    *Where did you find them?? Said Lizzy who was super happy I guess <br>
    she loves candy. In her side drawers I replied. We are almost done said Mr. Cody. Ok next house! Yes, let’s go * I put the candy in my bag * <br> </p>
    <p>
    We peeked outside from the window. Nobody was there. Let’s quickly go in to the alley way ok? Check the window from where we can see the alley way he said <br>
     to me. I checked the window there was no one there * they were waiting for my awnser * It’s clear I said showing them a thumbs up. I came to them. He, Mr. Cody <br>
     slowly opened the door one by one we all got out in to the alley way. </p> <br>
     <p>
    Ok next house sighed Mr. Cody. We went slowly to the next houses doorstep. Mr. Cody checked the windows nobody was there I checked a window too I saw a mad human! * I showed them a <br>
     thumbs down and making a cross sign and murmuring no don’t go! I went to them quickly and said it I dident want to take the risk. He nodded and we all went to the alley way. <br>
      Roxane suggested that we should go and empty our bags and we will think about it. We liked her suggestion and did so. Mrs. Sofia was glad that we were back home safely and she <br>
       also like the stuff we brought home she took all the candy and put in the bowl and she gave some candy to us, we could choose which one we wanted. <br> </p>
       <p>
    It was almost night. We weren’t going today. I went to sleep early but they woke me up for the dinner I wasn’t mad though I was happy that they woke me up. I loved the dinner <br>
     it was so good. Mrs. Sofia makes such good food! She told me that I could call her auntie or whatever he wanted to i9 went with auntie [couldent think of something more... <br>
      ok actually auntie was ok not that good but ok ] <br> </p>
    <p></p>  2 DAYS LATER
    I wanted to go home. Return to our usual lives which we breathed thankfully. I was finishing a story “and they lived happily ever after.” I read it, that sentence in my mind I mumbled <br>
    happily ever after. Only if anyone could be happy ever after. It’s not accurate is it? I closed the book forcefully and went up to the gallery furiously.<br></p>
    <p>
     I looked at the beautiful lonely sight. The moon was up, clouds sprinkled across the dark sky the stars looked like that somebody spilled a jar of glitter gleaming all over the sky.<br>
      The house was close to a crack which we can see the marvelous sky. I gazed at the city trying to find my house, I did find it my mom was looking down she was in the gallery it <br>
       was too dark to see but I knew it was her.<br>
     Her blonde hair was swinging. A slight smile started to give the impression on my heated look. But in the thought that we had lost our <br>
      dad the little cheerful adjustment which got to my face undo.  I couldent visualize her so sad she always stayed happy. I gave one ending look the sadness would only grow by seeing her <br>
       so sad, it would be the last time I saw her. Obedient to my heart, mind I turned around not daring to turn around.<br> </p>
       <p>
    I went away and sat on the sofa. That vision wouldn’t leave my attention. I was so desperate to go and appreciate that stunning sight once more I ran to the gallery <br>
     my mom was sitting in a swinging chair in the gallery looking at a book her adoring eyes giving little tears.  I tried to see what that book was I rapidly realized which book <br>
      it was by its shimmering glitter and the word ‘’MEMORIES” Colored golden it was a photo album which our memories were stored in. how I desired to be there embracing her. <br>
      I saw a lady come in hugged her parked herself alongside her with tears in her eyes, it was my thoughtful aunt. I closed my eyes. <br> </p>
      <p>
    I couldent picture how miserable, lonesome they would be feeling. My eyes dribbled tears gloomily. I wanted to shout run to her be with her every single slight moment of my life. <br>
     My sight got dull with those moist tears dripping from my eyes. I sat miserably crying. By now everybody was looking at me not daring to come. We’ll give you some time alone Billy auntie <br>
      Sofia softly said with her loving voice. I nodded wiping my tears. When I was done I decided to go with the others. My heart was drubbing my face was wretched, I was depressed. <br>
       I took one last little finale glaze and continued to my way. I took deep blows once it was to the steps I went down found everybody sad but rubbernecking at me as I just improved from <br>
       a hazardous disease. Food? Said Mrs. Cody in soothing voice Water? You must be dehydrated! After all that crying she offered me a cup of water we are with you dear Mrs. Sofia tried to ease me.<br>
        Mr. Cody provided me some noodles with steaming tea. You must be freezing she supplied me with a jersey and bed time! She shouted she looked at me and said not for you dear you may <br>
         remain feasting. @@@ <br></p>
         <p>
     After I was done instead of going to sleep I went to the gallery once yet again. Nobody was there in my houses gallery. An idea came in my mind. I ran to the room got a paper and I wrote down.<br>
      Billy, give a call to my house…sorry for your coat and knife. And I grabbed a coat .my phone and a knife. <br>
    I opened the door * sighed * I willingly made a loud noise from the door and I ran to the alley way. I heard Mr. and Mrs. Cody awoke they inspected the entrance and then  <br>
    I heard a shout Billy! The scream shock me for a second. They came outside looking for me my heart was walloping fast he looked around anxious, terrified his face was so wretched. <br>
     He sprinted in by the sight of some transmuted rats oncoming. I was regretting it until I saw Mrs. olives house I rapidly looked in the windows then I <br>
      entered the house I dident see anyone in the house it was as we left the house in the food hunt we did. <br> </p>
      <p>
    My phone rang! I became flustered and got my phone it was phone call from Mr. Cody I hanged it up at least they know that I remain alive. I had to endure on my path I dident want  <br>
    to reappear to Alex’s house. my house was on the street which is next to the street beside it. I continued on my way. first I looked form the windows if the rats were still there. <br>
    I saw a house I could see from its window it was clear. I ran over there using the alley way I was crossing the main road I saw a zombie passing by. I got cover and hid from the <br>
     zombie using a car. I accidently made a noise I heard the zombie he put his big, ugly hand on the car and gave a screech I got a shock and panicked. I had to do something I got my <br>
      knife ready anything could happen the mutated rat was right on the side of the car I got my nerve up and pierced the zombie my eyes were closed my face was petrified. Blood was <br>
       everywhere my hands… I was freezed looking at the blood in my hands I ran to the I saw previously. <br> </p>
       <p>
    Opened and shut the door and sat down *sighed* I looked at the house it was very messy. There were photographs. I went in a room it was very chaotic, disorganized there was an unaccustomed <br>
     shelf in the room. @@@ <br> </p>
     <p>
     It was very dust everything was covered in dust. There was picture of 3 people in the picture. There were two elders which might be the parents of the third person which  <br>
      Is a child, it looked like a joyful family to me. On the shelf. <br>
    I was looking at the stuff on the shelf. Almost in the middle of the shelf I saw some books there were ‘MEMORIES’ ‘Smile can make a change’ ‘How to study hard’ ‘Journal’ <br>
    when I saw journal I stopped at the thought I could probably read it. I around thinking if I should read. I took it out, it was covered in dust. I opened it wondering what would be <br>
     written inside. <br>
    In the first page there was written that <br>
    <hr>
                      Sticky note <br>
    Green: best day! <br>
    Orange: tragedy. <br>
    Red: mysterious.<br>
    Purple: Odd <br>
    I looked at the sticky noted sticking out I was eyeing then until I saw a page marked with three different colors Orange, <br>
    Red and purple. I had to know what was written on the page. I turned to that page. Here is what was written.<br>
    <em>Today I was outside on the food hunt. In the kitchen I climbed up a cabinet and in a corner I saw a green thing it looked delicious I couldent smell it because I had flu so I had no idea what is <br>
       smelled like. I was also hungry so I ate it. I felt very odd I was feeling very bad then I had to throw up. I dident tell my family because I dident want them to worry.</em> <br>
    It was the last page of the dairy <br> </p>
    <p>
     <em>I Dident write full page day after yesterday I haven’t been writing for two days because my situation is getting worse I got fever, sometime I lose my mind like <br>
        I am not alive my family tell me that sometime I get blackness or sometimes my family tell me that I act like a zombie I get blackness during that time. I don’t know what is happening to me. <br></em> </p>
    <p>
    That was all that was written down. All kind of thoughts came to my mind. What happened to him next? What happened to him? What was the green thing? There were many questions then  <br>
    I suddenly got a question which really made me think in to it. Is he the start of the virus? I took my bag and put the journal inside.  Form a window I could see my house; the windows  <br>
    were closed I decided to take the back door I think it would be more safe to go by the back door. There was no fence or like a garden It was an alley way good thing I found the keys for it <br>
     the keys were right below the rug.<br> </p>
     <p>
    I ran there I was finally in my house my expression got a smirk I happily knocked on my door. I heard a few noises I couldent hear properly. *mumbled noises* I softly said it’s me Billy. <br>
    *mumbled noises* The door flung open. @@@ <br> </p>
