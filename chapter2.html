    I went with my ball, to the ground. We met at the ground. Instead of playing, we started talking about the new ginger at who was a threat to us all, <br>
    my friend said that he thought that the owners were warning us for something very big, which had a very less chance of happening. After an hour of  <br>
    talking we all went home. My parents were in their room door shut, so was my aunts, it was very weird. I played roblox, Brookhaven, I finished it in night, <br>
     my mom put me to bed and tomorrow was school. <br>
    It was a rather dull day at school. My friends were having a meet-up after school. I went there. Mark asked that ‘Are any of your parents acting weird?’ <br>
    We all agreed that all of our parents were acting weird. Robert added that ‘All adults went to a top-secret meeting when the ginger cat appeared.’ <br>
     ‘That’s really… Odd…’ I said ‘Yeah it is.’ Agreed Alex. ‘I sneakily found it out, and nobody should tell that we know this, it’s for our own good.’  <br> </p>
     <p>
    We agreed on that. ‘Should we spy more on our parents? It will surely be a big risk’ I added ‘I don’t think so.’ Replied Robert.  <br>
    ‘No, let’s think about it.’ Said Alex. We all went home. We had a group, discord, I messaged there:<br>
    ME:  I think we should investigate this. <br>
    Alex: Ok can you put in more detail? <br>
    Me:  Well, not spying on out parents… like if we you <br>
    know... see like a person talking we might… you know <br>
    what I am talking about.<br>
    Robert: Yeah, I get it, That’s good… nice idea.<br>
    Roxanne:  It’s a risk, if they find out that we are listening  <br>
    to them, I don’t know.<br>
    Colin:  Yeah, a risk. <br>
    ‘Lights out!’  shouted my mom. <br>
    Me: Bye, bedtime for me.<br>
    And I went to sleep.<br> </p>
    <p>
                                Tomorrow <br>
    It was again a rather dull day at school. We, my friends and me arranged a restrount hang-out. I asked my dad for some money because my pocket money, I gave to my mom, <br>
    it was an emergency. He agreed not interested why I wanted it. <br>
    I went to my friend sat the restrount. ‘So, sup!?’ Nothing exiting happened just a normal dinner with friends, just talking about memes and much more. <br>

    We all were about to go home until we heard shouts everywhere, ‘REVENGE!’ ‘Slay the cat!’ We panicked. People were mad!  Some killed people ‘We need to go! Together!’ Colin shouted. <br>
    ‘My house is the closest!’ said Alex. ‘Lets go!’ They ran and ran. <br></p>
    <p>
    ‘Mrs. Olive!’ I shouted. We stopped. She was pushing everyone. She heard our shout and ran towards us. ‘RUN!’ Said Roxanne There was bombardment at the park, the ground we played in. <br>
    There was madness, violence everywhere, we got to her house knocked and shouted ‘MOM! MOM!’ we all shouted ‘MAAM SOFIA!’ she opened the door ‘Get in quick!’ Maam Sofia said and closed the <br>
    door she saw Mrs. Olive oncoming towards us. She thumped at the door madly and left. <br> </p>
    <p>
      We sighed. ‘Are you ok?’ she asked. ‘Yes’ we all said. Her dad, her little sister and her grandmother were looking at us. ‘Sit down’ said Mr. Cody, Alex’s dad. ‘How clever… running <br>
       to the nearest house.’ Mrs. Sofia admired. ‘Whats going on outside?’ I asked. ‘Violence, let’s see the news, we don’t know yet.’ He turned on the T.V <br>
                                       T.V <br> </p>
                                       <p>
    HOST: There has been, violence and madness around. People want to seek revenge for their dead. The murderer cat has killed up to 10 rats, it’s better for you to stay indoors~~~~ <br></p>
    <p>
    He turned the volume down with cc aka subtitles on so we could talk. <br>
    ‘I am worried about my parents can I call them?’ asked Roxanne. ‘Sure’ we all called our parents. They told us to stay until the madness was over. <br>
    There were wo children rooms, one for Alex, the other one for her sister, Lizzy. Girls will sleep in Alex’s room and Boys in Lizzy’s. We went to bed.<br>
    We all couldent sleep due to the noise of, violence and madness, but we somehow managed to go to sleep. It was a long mad night…. <br>
    Next morning there was a delicious smell of food. Bacon and eggs, pancakes and smoothies how delicious! ‘WOW! Such a nice breakfast.’ I said. ‘Glad you liked it’ Mrs. Sofia said delighted.<br>
    I ate it. It was so delicious! ‘Is the madness over?’ I asked. ‘A-a little’ Alex’s grandma said weakly. ‘Oh, granny!’ Alex went to her and sat down, their parents were happy too. Alex told us that she <br>
    dident talk, that was the first word that she had said in the week. <br></p>
    <p>
    After 2 minutes of admiring Maam Sofia’s skills. We played Hide- and- seek and some more amazing games. It was dawn Alex’s mother prepared us supper. <br>
    It was supper we had some biscuits, they were trying to save up food. Even if it was biscuits, I quite liked it though. Alex’s dad switched on the T.V <br> </p>
    <p>                                                 T.V <br>
    Host: Things got better but now are getting worse. People       are protesting to slay the cat and do quick. We don’t know what they have up their sleeves. <br>
    Now we have Dr. Lupin to tell us more about these people, who have gotten mad.<br>
    Dr. Lupin: Its nothing much complicated. They are mad for people of the dead.<br>
    Host: Indeed <br></p>
    <p>
    *coughs* Alex’s grandmother coughed and fell to the ground. Mrs. Sofia, Alex, Lizzy and Mr. Cody ran to her. We were completely stunned. Sobs filled the air. <br>
     ‘’We need a docter!’ said Lizzy. ‘It’s too mad outside!’ Colin complained. ‘We need to do something!’ said Mark. ‘Ambulance!’ Lizzy suggested. ‘No way! too risky!’ said Robert. <br>
    ‘Roxanne! Your parents were a docter do you know anything!?’  Roxanne freezed, she was panicking. ‘Anything c’mon! Anything!’ Roxanne fell to the ground and fainted with pressure. <br>
    ‘OH NO! Robert, Mark, Lily on to Roxanne the others to her’ [ Points to her grandmother] I said ‘I got some Ideas, Google what to do and CPR if it gets worse!’ I said. ‘It’s already worse!’ <br>
    said Mrs. Sofia. ‘Alex, Bill Google! I’ll CPR!!’ Mr.  Cody commanded. We went to her computer and wrote ‘’’Cure for a dying person?’’’ It came CPR or water, I tried water and unfortunately  <br>
    it dident work, but it was worth the try. <br></p>
    <p>
    Mr. Cody started CPR. And. *Gasps* she gasped. ‘OH MY!’ They carried her to her bed. <br>
                     A Few Days Later <br>
    The madness just got worse however the grandmother was getting better and so was Roxanne. We were running out of food. We all had our Cell-phones. Alex’s dad went for a food hunt. We all were  <br>
    very nervous that he might not return. <br></p>
    <p>
    Dad: I am ok. <br>
    Me: Thank-god! <br>
    Dad: Mad out here!<br>
    Me: Focus!<br>
    Dad: Almost there! <br>
    Dad: GOT IT! <br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>
    CoNecTIOn~~LoST <br>
    That was Alex’s Mobile. <br> </p>
    <p>
    ‘Oh no!’ We said. ‘We need to go!’ I declared and the other joined me. ‘We have a little experience with gaming and phone’s, we all will stay contact including you’ <br>
    “NO!” Mrs. Cody disagreed. ‘PLEASE! There is no winning without risk! Look please! There is chance of him returning but more is always better! You have to trust us!’ <br>

    There was silence for a moment. Look I am trusting you but   it’s a risk.  That’s not trusting!  You have to let us go If he goes maybe he will not be able to bring that much food.<br>
    Ah! Roxanne shouted. Everybody went over there Roxanne was awake. We told her what was happening. Roxanne you will stay because I don’t think you have fully recovered.<br>
    She agreed.You have to let us go, please. Ok Mrs. Sofia finally agreed.<br></p>

    <p>
    I’ll help you get everything ready, quick. Ok. After few minutes of preparing and making rules we were ready to go.<br>
    We all had mobiles so we had a voice call and with Mrs. Sofia too. We all had dark clothes so we couldn’t be spotted easily.<br>
    Mrs. Sofia had a scared and a nervous face.</p>
    <p>
    We went saying our good byes. We were together. We were almost there. Quiet. We saw a mad person going over there.<br>
    Dad! She whispers. We split up. We sneaked in from the back door of the mall. We were crouching. We saw Alex’s dad crouched, hiding from the mad person. We stayed there.<br>
    When the mad person was gone we crouched to him. What are you doing here? Long story. We took some stuff very careful.We divided the categories of food. Lizzy and I got breakfast.<br>
    I went in the cereal aisle getting some cereals.While Lizzy was getting eggs. After that we took that we went to check on others they were ready.</p><br>
    <p>
    We went home safely. Mrs. Sofia was delighted to see us. Ok now why were these kids there. Does it matter we helped you a lot Alex said? Aha agreed her dad. What did you get?<br>
    asked Mrs. Sofia. All of the foods I mean breakfast, lunch, supper, dinner and a little a bit of desert.Well the good news is Roxanne is alright.<br>
    Who’s ready for lunch! We all cheered. Mind a little help in the kitchen Lizzy. No problem mom. You can prepare the desert and I shall prepare the dinner Darling.<br>
    The other of us played happily. Our mothers and fathers would keep calling us from the day we were here. we made loads of noise. The grandmother keeps telling us to quiet down but we don’t.<br>
    we don’t mean not to listen to her.</p>
    <p>
    Thump! Thump! came the noises somebody was thumping on the door, everyone stared at the door. Come here boys and give me a hand. They put a small little cabinet in front <br>
    of the door it was not that big though not even that heavy I think it was like 24,25 kg.</p>
    <p>
    Thump! Came the noise again. It’s going to be ok said Mr. Cody, Alex’s Father. And everyone went back to their work they were doing Thump! Thump! <br>
    The noise kept going for a minute or two. Then it got much louder! We all stopped what we were doing and stared at it, curious. Thump! Thump! What do we do now I asked? <br>
    Ok, if they get in you all need to hide don’t care about anything do as you are said take it seriously and quiet.We agreed. Boys put things in front of the door. We went there and <br>
     I put a little table in front of it. And we need to cooperate be friends with everybody in this house! Thump! </p>
