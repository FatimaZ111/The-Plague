    In a big house there was a rat colony. The owners were kind of sick of it, they brought traps but sometimes we don’t get caught sometimes we escape but rarely we kind of… just die only one time <br>
     though. They have putten 11 traps but who know when they will stop putting it they have been putting these from the last 2 weeks.<br>
    So I am bill, a kid mouse. I am 13 years old.<br>  </p>
    <p>
    Its night! Shouted my mom at me. Don’t stay awake your aunt is coming to look after you, Me and dad are going to the food hunt. She walked to the cereal box door and said ‘Be nice to your her’ <br>
     and left. After 3 minutes or so my aunt came in Alexa Bartley ‘Hey! Can’t sleep? What about a story or two? Hmm?’ I replied yes because I love bedtime stories but not more than getting away.<br>
     My aunt took out a cut out of a cereal makers story and read I it to me, after six minutes it ended it was pleasurable. I acted I was asleep she looked at me and turned the lamp off and made her approach <br>
      to a reading chair and turned the lamp on. I sneaked out of my bed sneaking out is not hard for me. The door was a little open so I sneaked out pretty easily and ran out of the house. There are <br>
       people so I still sneaked. I ran near the stairs behind the stairs wall of course, I was almost their until I heard a voice ‘BILL! Where are you?’ she knew I would be here because we are so close. <br>
       </p>
       <p>
    I ran I heard the owners talking about us, but then I saw her, Alexa I don’t think she saw me though. I ran disappearing in to the thought that was that they were talking about us, I  <br>
    couldent hear properly. <br></p>
    <p>
    My aunt will tell my mom so I decided to go back. I went back sneakily. I was almost in my room that my aunt went by the house looking for me, the front door was open and she could see me. <br>
     ‘Well…Billy looks like you were in the house bot outside’ looks like she thought that I was in the house the whole time. “~~Sleepy, Billy. Sleep creepy Billy creep creep~~ now off to sleep” <br>

    We went in the room, I cuddled up she sat in her chair. I went in the thought of what they were saying and fell fast asleep. <br></p>
    <p>
    I Woke up with a start, got out of my bed and made my way to the bathroom, half-asleep I brushed my teeth, I got fresh. I went to the kitchen wondering what was in breakfast because I <br>
     couldent smell anything, everyday there was a scrumptious smell around the house at breakfast. I saw no one there, I looked at the clock it was 4 <br>
     ‘Oh, silly me…’ I looked around, I went to my parent’s room. My aunt was there, Mom and dad weren’t there. They haven’t come home yet I murmured to myself. I looked outside.  <br>
     I heard 2 people say ‘The owner went’ The first one said ‘Any idea why?’ the other one asked ‘I think to buy another trap’ They immediately started laughing. I Wanted to know why my parents   <br>
     weren’t here. I knew our nieghbour, Mrs. Olivia wakes up early every morning. So I could ask her about it. <br>
    I went to her doorstep and knocked on her door she came, it dident take her too long I asked her that if she knew anything about when my parents will come. ‘When will my parents come? Are they ok?’ <br>
     I asked her. She was old something like 62 I think. ‘I don’t know, they must be okay, they sometimes do come at 6 or 7 right?’ she said. ‘I think so’ ‘Thank You Mrs. Olive.’ I added I went back home. <br>
     I was almost home a question came in my mind ‘What if they are stuck in a trap!’ she was closing the front door when I ran to her, One more question ‘Yes bill…’ ‘Do you know anything about the traps?’ <br>
     </p>
     <p>
      I asked her ‘No, but I do know one thing we will always be safe’ she said with a smile on her face. It was her husband who had died from the trap so If I say something wrong it will offend her <br>
      feelings so I just continued with my other question ‘Do you know where the owners went? Any idea?’ I asked her eager to know the awnser. ‘That’s a question to ask the government’ she said wondering. <br>
      ‘Thanks again’ I said. I went home. <br>
    It was now 4:15, I dident know what to do, my aunt wakes up at 5, I had to do wait 55 more minutes for my aunt to wake up I dident want to disturb in her sleep. I read a book for roughly 40 minutes,<br>
     during I also waited around the door for my parents to come, or sometimes I just ran about the house doing pretty much nothing. Which pretty much felt like forever. <br>
    My aunt Finally woke up. ‘Hey, bill whats up?!’ said Aunt Alexa. ‘Mom and Dad aren’t here yet’ I said. ‘Í am sure they will come’ Aunt said focused on making breakfast. After eating breakfast,<br>
     and a big talk. It was 6:00. Somebody knocked on our door. It was Mrs. Olive. ‘They are home! Alexa, Bill come! It’s bad!’ she said trembling. Wha- Until I saw what we worse feared! a cat! A ginger cat!
    Everyone was stunned to the look. Then suddenly everybody ran to their houses, panicked, some even went to their offices. <br> </p>
              <p>                      TOMMOROW <br>
    My aunt woke me up. ‘Good news, in fact two good news!’ My aunt said to me excitedly. I woke up with a start. ‘What is it?’ I said sleepily. ‘Your parents are back! And the other is that i <br>
     am officially going to stay here!’ she said gladly. ‘That’s awesome I said happily’ After brushing my teeth and washing my face I greeted my parents, got in to a long talk about where they were. <br>
      ‘Do you know anything about the cat dad?’ I asked my dad eager to find an awnser. ‘No not yet, Sleep, and no buts’ Mom and dad made their way to their room so did Aunt Alexa. As I was left <br>
       alone in the dining room I knew they were hiding something. <br>
    I quietly went to sleep. <br> </p>
    <p>
    The next morning, it was all quiet until my Aunt Alexa said ‘It’s a nice morning! Anyone… smoothies!?’ We cheered everyone started on a talk on which flavor is best and why while <br>
     the smoothies were being prepared. She asked for what should be the flavor I choose mango. <br>
    After a few minutes, my aunt Alexa asked what we would like for the topping and decoration, I went with whip cream shaped like a cone on my smoothie and add multi-color sprinkles  <br>
    and a little strawberry as an add on. I mean, Mongo flavored smoothies with whip cream on top, also an add on strawberry with sprinkles!!! Wont it be delicious! <br>
    There came the smoothies, they smelled, tasted and looked delicious. There was already water in my mouth! We finished them. After a minute of admiring my Aunts cooking skills, <br>
     I went to play with my friends <br> </p>
