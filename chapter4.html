    I just took a glance at who it was and I embraced my mom instantly, closing my eyes my expression turned in to a happy face out of the miserable look I had when I was away from my family.<br>
    Billy! *gasps* What- are you ok!? Why would you—my mom squeezed me back delighted I was here. The reason that she dident complete her sentence because she was simply contented that I was here.<br>
     I was really happy to be here, here home with my family which I exultant to be given. There is no home without a family. <br></p>
     <p>
    I looked at her happiest I have been in my life. My Aunt was completely stunned. Bill!? Exclaimed my aunt rapidly recovering from her stunned and flabbergasted self.  <br>
    The phone rang interposing our blissful moment. That must be the Cody’s said My aunt Alexa which I was also happy to be with. <br></p>
    <p>
    My aunt answered it saying Hello? *mumbled noises*Yes he is here my aunt was saying happily *mumbled noises* He looks like, he hasn’t told us yet *mumbled noises* He just came in. <br>
     *mumbled noises* Cya, Thankyou again from Me and from Julia too. My mom softly said Thanks. Julia was my mother Julia Carterson, Carterson was our family name My dad’s name was William.<br>
      A thought raced in to my mind which made me sad I tried to make my face pleased so it couldent effect this amazing moment but the thought wouldn’t leave my mind. <br>
    My mom realized I wasent happy something was bothering me she often does realize when I am angry or sad or happy even though when I am hiding it. <br> </p>
    <p>
    Sit down darling and tell us everything but first *we sit down* <br>
    I am so happy you are here but you took a big risk you risked your life to come here you must be very desperate to some to your family and home…and please dont talk about William <br>
     *silence in the room* It just makes us sadder Mom added. Even though it is very hard for us but let’s not talk about it. <br> </p>
     <p>
    She smiled to make the mood happier. *mom takes deep breath* *I yawned* Sleep? Said my Aunt. Sure I said while yawning. Well Goodnight! Have a nice night! Said mom. <br>
     So did aunt Alexa. But my mom asked me have you eaten dinner? I replied Yes, but would it hurt to have your charming food if it is left? It is my mom said happily, it is spaghetti your favorite!  <br>
    YEAH! Amazing! My mom was very happy I was finally home back to my family. She was taking the left-over food and putting in the plate. I took my bag and took out the journal <br>
     I dident open it I was staring at the cover page wondering if I should read it now my mom put the food in the microwave. <br>
    Whats that sweet Billy? Asked my aunt. Oh nothing Aunt Alexa I replied and I put it in my bag. @@@ <br> </p>
    <p>
     Oh…well never mind. <br>
    I saw her going to my mom. My mom looked at her. Auntie said piercingly ‘I am so glad Billy is here back to his home however he took a big risk’ My aunt said. My mom favorably accepted.<br>
     I think my aunt did that so she could raise off suspicion. <br> </p>
     <p>
    But I think she under estimated me or probably I over estimated her. I couldent possibly over estimate, she would be trying to presage me that I am going to tell my mom that I am hiding <br>
    something which is the right choice to make because if I was her I would tell her or try to ease me plentiful so I can tell her. <br>
    My mom wouldn’t try to vigor me and let me tell her what I was hiding she would do something, something more cunning. I just did that I seized my bag and opened it  <br>
    and I headed for the nearby table there was a book there. I seized the book and smacked it in my bag.  <br> </p>
    <p>
    I dident close it I would be raising suspicion so I took hold of some more books and I said ‘I am taking some books for me to read at lights out it will get hard to sleep <br>
     after the stuff I have been through’. <br> </p>
     <p>
    My aunt was looking at me but she turned around by the sight of me looking at her trying to wonder what was with her. I knew what was going on she was just trying to see what was  <br>
    going on with me. The micro-wave bell ringed my food was ready. My mom served me the food I had already sat down. ‘Thanks!’ I gratefully said. My Aunt went to the stuck-cabinet. <br></p>
    <p class="stuck-cabinet">
     The stuck-cabinet is a cabinet which we named now you might wonder The Stuck cabinet? Yes, its so-called after what come to pass nearly a 5 years ago. It was May 20th It was a normal, sunny day but <br>
      not sunny for long. <br>
    The T.V weather forecast came that it was about to rain in about half an hour. For the next 20 minutes the just kept telling us that they are sorry for late announcements because <br>
     of some technical problems. <br>
    Dad had bought me a slide wooden toy i loved. My dad yesterday also May 19th he had nailed its leg because they kept falling and mom and dad were worried that I might get injured so they <br>
     nailed it but only in time for one, single leg. ‘My toy dad!’ I shouted. ‘Ok, yes’ He took hammer and started to take the nail out good thing he only had time to nail one leg.  <br>
     After 29 minutes my mom complained that you have had no progress and it going to rain in a minute. After a minute or two it started to rain a little. And he finally got it out.  <br>
    I was jumping around worried about my toy because I loved it so much. @@@ <br>
